# Portfolio_Data_Analyst
Some works i made for my future carrer as data analyst

At first, we have SQL queries that helped me to analyze the COVID scenario around the world.
In second place i was working on my skills on busines intelligence with Power BI and Tableau.
Also i need to advise that the excel tables i used as datasets were too big and doesnt fit here. If you want it you can ask it on my email: rafaellanders23@gmail.com 
Further applications in python showed to be necessary.
